//Conditions that this program works on:
//1-user does not already have conflicting events (MAYBE)
//2-user does not have events that span over midnight (MAYBE)
//3-user does not have all-day events(MAYBE)
//problems 1 & 2 solved by assessing array prior to inputting time slots and converting to suitable array

//next steps is to create an event when the program finds an open slot
//put it in a separate file - sep 9
//try to write a test - sep 9

//MAJOR MAJOR FIX: IT IS SCHEDULING IN EACH TIME SLOT, NOT JUST THE FIRST ONE! - solved
//new problem: it is scheduling one per time slot but we want to be able to schedule 2 within a given time slot - solved


//add to github: enhancement: schedule only once per calendar day (make this an option) / evenly schedule per scheduling period
//enhancement: if scheduling within the same time slot, put a time gap in between
//
